# Rich Lysakowski, Ph.D.
#### AI and Business Analytics Software Developer, Data Scientist, Senior Business Analyst, Process Engineer, Database and Systems Administrator

<p dir="auto" align="left">
Passionate about working with leading-edge technologies for intelligent data discovery and collection, data analytics, visualization, and reporting in industrial and business environments.  Technical expertise includes full SDLC skills for application and system analysis, design, programming, debugging, deployment, support, and training.  Favorite languages are Python, SQL, and web languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript), in Windows, Linux, and Docker environments, and (when required) Cloud environments.  
    
## Current R&D Work
I actively research and develop techniques, applications, and training to harness powerful Generative AI, Prompt Engineering, and intelligent workflow chaining systems using Large Language Models.  I have experience with 100s of Python packages to develop applications and utilities for AI, intelligent analytics, predictive analytics, statistical analysis, machine learning and deep learning, and web-based systems.  I have 30+ years experience an expert trainer and educator developing and delivering training curricula, courses, workshops, and short courses.  

I love applying my business analysis and technical skills in large and small enterprises.  I am an acknowledged SME expert in data and records management, IT systems, and scientific and lab informatics across the value chain (R&D through Manufacturing) in pharmaceuticals and biotech, and Finance.  Contact me to learn more and engage my skills on your project.

## Development Work
In my personal time, I am actively using the latest Generative AI developer and end user tools and packages.  I am working on to SMARTLY SIMPLIFY advanced AI and data analytics for business and scientific applications.  Currently there are (too) many steep learning curves for people to climb before they can apply AI technologies.  There is too much NOISE about AI -- and not enough SIGNAL.  We need to discover first-hand what really works, and raise the baseline of AI wisdom high above the popular media's noise.  My job as a trainer and educator is to create knowledge, transfer hard implementation skills, and instill know-how in my trainees and clients.  AI technology is advancing FAST toward "AGI" -- right now in baby steps -- but major breakthroughs within months will cause seimic shifts in the balance of power between humans and AI agents.  

Every day I am testing yet another LLM Agent builder application like AutoGPT, MetaGPT, LocalGPT, DoctorGPT, babyAGI, DB-GPT, GPT-Engineer, AutoGen Studio, and other domain-specific tools.  My goal is to learn Language Models (LLMs) as much as possbile and apply them to text, imagery, sound, and music to create comprehensive and multi-modal generative experiences to accelerate human learning and individual power.  One current project is to generate a current State-of-the-Art (SOTA) AI Guide and Developer Assistant for Prompt Engineering and Intelligent Agent Chaining Systems.  New cutting-edge tools appear weekly, far too fast for regular humans to master in a normal workweek.  We need automated real-time knowledge acquisition tools that simplify and transparently explain the new tools to newbies, "on demand" and "just-in-time" in the moment when human curiosity arises.

## Democratized AI-Powered By End Users Throughout the World
I have a very strong commitment to ensuring that we can run "democratized" high-performing LOCAL AI systems -- that is 100% OFF-THE-CLOUD -- without requiring ANY major cloud platforms.  Our LOCAL AI systems must not be considered "edge" nodes on the global internet.  What people call "The Cloud" is a few Big Tech cloud platform vendors WITH COMMON GOALS TO INSOURCE AND CONTROL AS MANY IT JOBS AND AS MUCH AI POWER AS POSSIBLE.  They conspire in their commitment to lead the AI Arms race and beat or consume competitors anywhere they arise.  Big Tech companies are steadily and substantially in-sourcing tech jobs to their own corporations, leaving millions of citizens without meaningful work.  

## Get Out of the Borg - User-Centric Computing
If normal citizens don't re-power, re-source, and revert "The Cloud" back to "The Edge", then entire segments of white, brown, and blue collar workers will be marginalized within the next 5-10 years.  Big Tech Cloud vendors will CONTROL ALL JOBS they insource.  Once they control ("OWN") them, they will place these jobs anywhere that quality labor is cheapest.  AI software agents require only electricity to work.  AI software agents don't need salaries, nutrition, nurturing, sleep, exercise, sex, emotional support, or other "human overhead".  AI agents are an obvious endpoint to place many jobs.  The argument that AI cannot produce the same high-level of quality as humans can is simply wrong.  AI already (often) produces higher quality and consistency for many tasks and products.  AI systems quality and sophistication are improving faster than most people can understand.  As more jobs move to the cloud or disappear, people left on "The Edge" will be marginalized.  The Cloud takes power away from the individuals and gives it to Big Tech.  Local, democractized AI brings power back to the people.  

Individuals must ensure that AI stays democratized and runs equally well locally, off-the-cloud (and online only when absolutely required).  Big Tech Cloud providers will prevail otherwise.  

***Remember "Human Lives Matter" (HLM)!  Cloud computing is a tool, not the endpoint for society.***
