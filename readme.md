# Rich Lysakowski, Ph.D.
#### AI and Business Analytics Developer, Data Scientist, Senior Business Analyst and Process Engineer, Database and Systems Administrator

<p dir="auto" align="left">
Passionate about working with leading-edge technologies for intelligent data discovery and collection, data analytics, visualization, and reporting in industrial and business environments.  Technical expertise includes full SDLC skills for application and system analysis, design, programming, debugging, deployment, support, and training.  Favorite languages are Python, SQL, and web languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript), in Windows, Linux, Docker, and Cloud environments.  I am actively researching and developing techniques, applications, and training to harness powerful Generative AI, Prompt Engineering, and intelligent workflow chaining systems using Large Language Models.  I have experience using 100s of Python packages to develop applications and utilities for AI, intelligent analytics, predictive analytics, statistical analysis, machine learning and deep learning, and web-based systems.  I have 30+ years experience an expert trainer and educator developing and delivering curricula, courses, workshops, and short courses.  I love applying my business analysis and technical skills in large and small enterprises.  I am an acknowledged SME expert in data and records management, IT systems, and informatics across the value chain (R&D through  Manufacturing) in pharmaceuticals and biotech, and Finance.<br><br> Contact me to learn more and engage my skills on your project.

In my personal time, I am actively using the latest Generative AI developer and end user tools and packages.  I am working on to SMARTLY SIMPLIFY advanced AI and data analytics for business and scientific applications.  Currently there are many steep learning curves for people to climb before they can intelligently apply AI technologies.  There is too much NOISE about AI -- and not enough SIGNAL.  We need to discover first-hand what really works, and raise the baseline of AI wisdom high above the popular media's noise.  My job as a trainer and educator is to develop knowledge, hard implementation skills, and tools know-how in my trainees amd clients.  AI technology is advancing FAST toward "AGI" -- right now its baby steps -- but within months major breakthroughs will cause seimic shifts in the balance of power between humans and AI agents.  Every day I am testing yet another LLM applications like AutoGPT, MetaGPT, LocalGPT, DoctorGPT, DB-GPT, GPT-Engineer, and other domain-specific tools.  My goal is to deeply understand Language Models (LLMs) and apply them to text, imagery, sound, and music to create comprehensive and multi-modal generative experiences to accelerate human learning and individual power.  A current project is to generate a current State-of-the-Art (SOTA) AI Guide and Developer Assistant for Prompt Engineering and Intelligent Agent Chaining Systems.  New cutting-edge tools appear weekly, far too fast for regular humans to stay to master in a normal workweek. 

I also have a very strong and active interest in running high-performing AI LOCAL "democratized" systems that run locally (100% "offline") without requiring any major cloud platforms.  These LOCAL systems must not be considered "edge" nodes on the global internet.  What people call "The Cloud" is a few large cloud platform vendors CONSPIRING TOGETHER TO INSOURCE AND CONTROL ALL JOBS in IT and computing, in-source them to their own corporations, leaving millions of citizens without meaningful work.  If normal citizens don't re-source "The Cloud" back to "The Edge", entire segments of white collar and brown collar society will be marginalized within the next 10 years.  Big Tech Cloud vendors will OWN, i.e., control, all the jobs they insourced to their cloud business, and can easily place the work anywhere that labor is cheapest, including to automated software agents.  People on "The Edge" will be on the margins of society.  Local, democractic AI brings power back to the people.  The Cloud takes power away from the people.  Let's make sure AI stays democratized, offline and online.  

<br><br>
Remember "Human Lives Matter" (HLM)!  Cloud computing is a tool, not the endpoint for society.
