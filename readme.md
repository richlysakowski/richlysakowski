# Rich Lysakowski, Ph.D.
#### AI and Business Analytics Developer, Data Scientist, Senior Business Analyst and Process Engineer, Database and Systems Administrator

<p dir="auto" align="left">
Passionate about working with leading-edge technologies for intelligent data discovery and collection, data analytics, visualization, and reporting in industrial and business environments.  Technical expertise includes full SDLC skills for application and system analysis, design, programming, debugging, deployment, support, and training.  Favorite languages are Python, SQL, and web languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript), in Windows, Linux, Docker, and Cloud environments.  I have experience using 100s of Python packages to develop applications and utilities for AI, intelligent analytics, predictive analytics, statistical analysis, machine learning and deep learning, and web-based systems.  I am an expert technology trainer and educator with decades of experience developing and delivering curricula, courses, workshops, and short courses.  I love applying my business analysis and technical skills in large and small enterprises.  <br><br> Contact me to learn more and engage my skills on your project.

In my personal time, I am actively exploring and engaging with generative AI, to expand my knowledge and hard implementation skills in this area. I have been experimenting with and developing applications to harness powerful generative AI,  LLMs, prompt engineering, and LLM chaining techniques.  I am investigating and testing the many baby steps toward "AGI", applications of LLMs like AutoGPT, MetaGPT, LocalGPT, and the many vertical knowledge domain-specific applications like DoctorGPT.  My goal is to deeply understand Language Models (LLMs) and apply them to text, imagery, sound, and music to create more comprehensive and multi-modal generative experiences to accelerate human learning.  My current "pr√≤iseact l√†ithreach na seachdain" ("bie≈ºƒÖcy projekt tygodnia") is to leverage Large Language Model to generate a near-realtime State-of-the-Art (SOTA) Guide for the field of Prompt Engineering and related cutting-edge techniques that move too fast for regular humans to stay on top of in a normal workweek. 

I also have a very strong and active interest in running local "offline" high-performing AI "democratized" systems that do not use major cloud platforms, and that are not considered "edge" nodes on the global internet.  What people call "The Cloud" is really a small set of large cloud platform vendors CONSPIRING to outsource (read "OWN") all IT and computing jobs to themselves, leaving millions of citizens without meaningful work.  If normal citizens don't outsource "The Cloud" to what cloud vendors call "The Edge", entire segments of white collar and brown collar society will be marginalized within the next 10 years.  The "Edge" is also the margins of society.  Democracy brings power back to the people.  The Cloud takes power away from the people.  Let's make sure AI stays democratized, offline and online.  Remember "Human Lives Matter" (HLM)!
